  <div class="infobox-body"><div class="infobox-header">MISSIONS GUIDE</div>

Missions are a staple of the Naruto Universe and have a large part in the NARUTO SAGA experience. Contextually speaking, missions are assignments handed down from the administration of a village or organization to members, ranked according to difficulty and reward.

On SAGA, missions are treated as reward-giving writing prompts that have a variety of additional uses. Additionally, missions are sorted into one of four categories: <b>Normal, Plot, Crime,</b> and <b>Seasonal</b>.

<div class="infobox-header">MISSION CATEGORIES</div>

<b>Normal Missions</b> exist in their own bubble; that is to say, these are missions that any number of people can take, even if the end result disrupts continuity, such as assassinating a specific target. Normal missions can be repeatable and can be labeled as crime. These missions can be created by anybody.

<b>Plot Missions</b> are missions that only exist until they are completed. Plot missions are prompts that can directly affect or change the world on varying degrees of scale, ranging from saving a simple plot NPC all the way up to complete village destruction. Unlike normal missions, these do not take place in their own bubble, their effects are felt by everyone. Plot missions are not repeatable. These missions can be created by anybody.

<b>Crime Missions</b> are missions that are normally illegal or directly antagonistic against another player, group, or village. These missions have their own guidelines, which can be found <u><a href="http://naruto-saga.com/index.php?act=Pages&pid=23">here</a></u>.

<b>Seasonal Missions</b> are special missions that come and go with seasonal board changes. Some seasonal missions may be instance-based, plot-based, or they may have their own special rules and rewards, but once the season changes and they’re gone, they’re gone for good. These missions can only be created by staff.

<div class="infobox-header">MISSION RANKS</div>
As previously mentioned, missions are sorted by rank according to their difficulty and reward. These ranks follow a similar letter-based convention as Skill Ranks, starting at D-Rank and going up to Legendary. Missions require adequate shinobi rank in order to be taken in the first place; you must be at least one rank below the mission's rank in order to qualify. This means that a Genin (D-Rank equivalent) could only take missions up to C-Rank, whereas a Tokujo (B-Rank equivalent) could take missions up to A-Rank.

<b>D-Rank Missions</b> are simple missions, typically given to Genin, and are usually mundane tasks such as locating lost items or helping out a local business. These missions never require travel outside your own village, are not dangerous, and will rarely if ever involve combat.

<b>C-Rank Missions</b> are moderately more dangerous missions that are much more likely to involve combat than D-Rank Missions. However, these threats of combat are usually low risk, and involve tasks that are still relatively simple or mundane, such as delivering letters or guarding low-risk travelers.

<b>B-Rank Missions</b> are missions that involve much more danger; not necessarily combat per se, although the possibility is ever present. B-Rank missions typically involve defense of some sort, such as escorting trade caravans, guarding moderate-risk areas, investigating low to moderate-risk crime, or participating in the lowest risk minor nation conquests.

<b>A-Rank Missions</b> are high-risk missions that almost exclusively involve life-risking tasks in which death is a very real possibility. These missions may include espionage, assassination, investigation of high-risk crimes, high-risk defense or escort assignments, and so on. Additionally, A-Rank missions make up the bulk of minor nation conquests.

<b>S-Rank Missions</b> are notoriously difficult, dangerous, and are not for the faint of heart. These missions are some of the most high-risk assignments that a shinobi might find themselves doing; assassination of high value targets, infiltration of other villages or nations, large-scale attacks or destruction, and so on are all examples of what an S-Rank mission might entail.

<b>Legendary Rank Missions</b> are practically mythical in terms of their difficulty; these are suicide missions where survival isn't only unlikely, its not even expected. These missions are rare, dangerous, and unlike anything a shinobi will have ever experienced.

<div class="infobox-header">MISSION REQUIREMENTS</div>
In order to emulate the difficulty and effort required for the varying levels of difficulty on missions, each mission has a different set of requirements that must be met in order for the mission to be considered 'complete'.

<div class="infobox-header">MISSION REWARDS</div>
The main allure of the system is the rewards you receive for successfully completing the mission. Mission rewards apply to all characters that participate in the mission; but be aware that there must be participation in the mission in order to claim these rewards. Simply being present in the thread does not qualify you for mission rewards or completion.
