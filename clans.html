Clans on SAGA are bloodlines that share a common ancestor with a unique ability. These abilities manifest as <b>Kekkei Genkai</b> or <b>Kekkei Tōta</b>. These terms are interchangeable on SAGA and do not differ mechanically, colloquially simplified to <b>Kekkei Genkai</b> or simply as <b>KKG</b>.

Clan abilities are, as previously mentioned, unique. This means that when a clan is created with a certain concept or mechanic as an ability, this ability is "locked" to that clan, disallowing future clans from using that same ability or concept unless given permission, therefore making it unavailable for regular use. It should be noted that clans cannot hijack existing concepts that exists prior to the clan's creation with the intention of locking it away.

<div class="infobox-header">NON-CLAN AND UNDISCOVERED</div>
Firstly, before getting into the creation of clans, some players may find for some reason or another that they don't want their character to have a clan. This can be that no clans appeal to them, they want to create a clan at a later date, or they simply don't want their character in a clan. On SAGA, the terms "Non-clan" and "Undiscovered" can be used interchangeably for characters that do not belong to a clan.

Clanless characters, also known as Undiscovered characters, simply do not yet belong to a clan. This can be the case for as long as the character exists, or until the player finds a clan they want to add their character to.

There is no inherent cost to joining a clan, however there is one requirement: The Undiscovered character must meet all the requirements of the clan they wish to join. (i.e the Hozuki clan requires Water Release) For advanced element clans, Undiscovered characters must simply possess the constituent base elements before joining. These requirements are listed in the clan's page and typically involve an element or specialization. Attempting to join a clan locked to a village different from your character's still requires permission from the Kage to do so.

To finalize this process, you must submit a modding request on the Discord server and fill in the required details.

<div class="infobox-header">KEKKEI GENKAI AND TŌTA</div>
Kekkei Genkai and Tōta refer to the collective abilities, bonuses, boons, weaknesses, and drawbacks that members of a clan enjoy and suffer.

There are very few limits in regards to the creation of these abilities, affording players a great deal of creativity when it comes to inventing new mechanics, concepts, descriptors, and so on.

One of the core concepts of clan creation is balance. Clans must be balanced on a <b>1:1</b> basis. What this means is that for every strength/bonus/boon that a Kekkei Genkai grants, it must have an equivalent drawback. This is oftentimes easier said than done, and due to the amount of creative freedom that comes with clan creation, it can easily become a process of trial and error.

<div class="infobox-header">CLAN ABILITIES</div>
Kekkei Genkai abilities are split into a few different categories: <b>Active</b> and <b>Passive</b>.

Active abilities are abilities that must be activated through some means in order to enjoy their benefits, or suffer their drawbacks. Examples of this type would be <b>Dōjutsu</b> such as the Sharingan or Byakugan, where the user only enjoys the effects and suffers the drawbacks while the Dōjutsu is active.

Passive abilities are abilities that are "always on", so to speak, otherwise meaning that a character will always benefit or suffer the drawback without needing to first activate the ability. Examples of this type would be the Uzumaki or Hoshigaki's chakra pool increase.

<b>Active abilities cannot balance interchangeably</b>. This means that you cannot use an active drawback to balance a passive bonus, but you can use a passive drawback to balance an active bonus. If an ability is always "on", or the character otherwise always enjoys its benefits, the drawback that balances it must also always be on.

Clans are afforded a maximum of <b>four independent bonuses</b> under normal circumstances. Canon clans may bend this rule slightly, at staff discretion. Some concepts deemed exceptionally powerful or too broad by staff, but not so much that they are unacceptable, may be required to occupy additional slots.

<div class="infobox-header">GENERAL LIMITS</div>
The creativity that clan creation involves means that guidelines are relatively lax. There are few hard-defined limits on what is and is not acceptable. Therefore, it is the responsibility of players and staff to work together to create a balanced environment; it is not solely on the shoulders of one party. Below are some examples of effects that are both allowed and disallowed, and will be updated over time. Additionally some of the effects can be found in the Jutsu Guideline under the "Jutsu effects & Limited descriptors" spoiler.
