		<b>Ranks</b> on SAGA are divided into two different categories: Skill Rank and Shinobi Rank.

		Skill Rank is a letter-grade determining the actual ability of the character; it determines chakra reserves, availability of jutsu and the cost of using higher ranked techniques as well as the number of characteristics a character can choose. Skill Rank is determined by post count and investment.

		Shinobi Rank is a named rank determining the character’s place in the military hierarchy of shinobi, such as Genin, Chūnin, Jōnin, and so on. Shinobi Rank determines the grade of missions that a character could take. This means that, even if a character’s Skill Rank was S but their Shinobi Rank was Genin, they would only be able to take missions marked for Genin.

		<b>Events can only be used once per rank up</b> and only apply to the rank they were joined at, and cannot be 'saved' from earlier rank ups.

		<div class="infobox-header">STARTING CHARACTER RANKS</div>
		Upon creation, a character can start as high as a B-Rank Tokujo, and adjust either Skill or Shinobi rank up to those limits as desired. However, a character's Shinobi rank may never exceed their Skill rank by more than 1 rank (i.e: A Tokujo would require C-Rank Skill at the minimum), be this through creation or normal progression.

Noted in the Traits Guide, characters that start at E-Rank receive an additional trait slot.

			<b>Shinobi Rank Rewards</b> are granted when an individual has met the requirements and successfully been promoted. It is important to note that the Secondary ranks are in general completely up to the Kage of the village to bestow on its members. This means, that even if you fit the bare minimum required below, that rank up to that rank might still be denied.

			Because the position of a 'Kage' is a title, and not a rank, they are technically able to take any rank of mission due to their administrative position. However, missions are no less dangerous for them. For purposes of Shinobi Rank rewards, Kage count as Eiyūnin.

		</div>

		<div class="infobox-header">KAGE POSITIONS</div>
			The <b>Kage</b> of a village is revered as that conglomerate's strongest shinobi, unrivaled by their peers. With this responsibility comes expectations and rewards that operate outside what is normally attainable by regular shinobi. When a character takes the position of Kage and actively holds that responsibility for two months, they are awarded an <b>additional 50 Chakra</b> to their pool. It should be noted that this bonus only lasts for as long as the character retains the position of Kage and is removed upon them stepping down from their duties.

Additionally, Kage are capable of attaining all rewards on the above progression lists up to and including Eiyūnin. They must still meet the minimum requirements, however attaining these rewards, sans the bonus chakra, do not count toward their village totals.
