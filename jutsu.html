        <b>Jutsu</b> or <b>Techniques</b>, are the meat of the NARUTO setting. The guidelines we have in place are extensive; not to limit creativity or the scope of what your characters are capable of accomplishing, but to provide direction toward helping your techniques be approved as quickly and efficiently as possible while maintaining a healthy, fun environment for everybody.

        All characters receive <b>3 free jutsu of equal rank to their Skill Rank</b> on creation. These techniques can be traded down (i.e 1 C-Rank technique becomes 2 D-Rank techniques) but cannot be traded up (i.e 2 C-Rank techniques become 1 B-Rank technique).

        <div class="infobox-header">INTRODUCTION & BASICS</div>
        <details><summary>IN-DEPTH JUTSU CREATION GUIDE</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">The last thing we want is to bog down your roleplaying experience. So, while we are able to help you fix your jutsu, we want the application process to be as streamlined for you as possible. In order to make jutsu, you must first know their components. The following are four key pieces to any technique, and all techniques require these four things:

                <div class="infobox-header">THE DESCRIPTOR</div>
                Despite the phenomenal power of chakra, there must be a basic way in which you manipulate it to form your jutsu. Every technique has a method of how it achieves its Effects, called the Descriptor. While the Effect of a jutsu may be burning, the Descriptor could be different things, such as fire or electricity. Likewise, a technique that halts movement could be a physical binding, paralysis of the nervous system, an illusory impediment, or any sort of means that one can imagine. Descriptors tell us what the jutsu is doing in character and how it accomplishes the effect, instead of applying an effect without contextual information. They assist in telling us what happens when two jutsu of certain descriptors interact.

                For instance, a stealth technique that conceals heat signatures is countered by a sensory technique that detects them, at equal rank, due to the sensory technique detecting the descriptor of the concealing technique. These descriptors are the most important facet of telling others how your technique functions.

                <div class="infobox-header">THE EFFECT</div>
                If technique Descriptors are the “how”, the Effect is the “what”. Effects are the mechanical repercussions or benefits of a given technique, such as damage, stat buffs or debuffs, defensive capability, or utility effects (e.g. - blinding, terrain manipulation, etc). Technique effects determine what will happen when a technique is performed, hits somebody else, or otherwise interacts with the world. Effects are secondary in telling staff and other roleplayers how your technique interacts with other jutsu, especially by naming certain descriptors; for example, a fire technique that specifically evaporates water techniques, or a wind technique that siphons oxygen from an area to smother flames.

                The duration of an effect is always measured in a count of posts; Saga’s fluid-time system is not conducive to effects that last a certain number of seconds, minutes, or otherwise.

                <div class="infobox-header">THE SUBJECT</div>
                Once you have a “how” and “what” to your jutsu, you need to decide a “who”. This is often but not always equated to range; think about what types of jutsu or people your technique might affect specifically, especially if it’s not exactly stated in the technique’s range. This can be thought of as what a technique is capable of ‘targeting’, generally speaking techniques with more specific targeting are able to perform effects more precisely, but suffer from the obvious limitation of only being useful in niche situations.

                <div class="infobox-header">THE LIMITER</div>
                Even the most powerful technique suffers from a blind spot, a weak point, or some means of combating it. Alternatively, Limiters can be comprised of mechanical limiters on one’s effects or subjects, restricting the range and targeting capacity of a jutsu or its outright power in damage or other capacities.

                Two contrasting examples are the Planetary Devastation technique and a simple Great Fireball. The Fireball suffers from a linear attack range and need for inhaling to complete the jutsu despite its large projectile size and fairly high power. Conversely, the Planetary Devastation technique is nearly impossible to combat creatively, but its gravitational pull attracts all jutsu to its core, making it possible to defeat even without aiming properly.</div>

        <details><summary>CREATING AND LEARNING JUTSU</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">In order to create jutsu, you must make a thread called a <b>Jutsu Registry</b> by <a href="http://naruto-saga.com/index.php?act=Post&CODE=00&f=13">clicking here</a>. You can choose to apply for techniques from our list of Library Jutsu, also found in the Jutsu forum, or create your own using the template below.

                Simply edit the first post in your jutsu registry every time you wish to have them reviewed, then make a post in the Discord server's " #modding-request " channel. A moderator will quote and post their approval in your jutsu registry thread, or require further deliberation with you in order to create balance to the best of their ability.

                Once a jutsu has been approved, you can then purchase the jutsu, of which each has a rank-dependent cost. Once paid for, the jutsu can be stored for reference by creating a Jutsu List topic in the <a href="http://naruto-saga.com/?showforum=33">Jutsu List board</a> corresponding to the character's village.

                Do not take other members' custom jutsu or make similar techniques that copy original ideas without permission or seeing it IC extensively. Be sporting.

                The base chakra cost increases incrementally based on the difference in the casting character's Skill Rank and the rank of the technique. Please read the 'Jutsu Limits' section of the guide below.</div></details>

        <details><summary>INTERACTIONS</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Interactions are the value SAGA uses to determine the winning technique during clashes. They also determine whether or not a technique remains active; a jutsu is ended when it loses all of its interaction potential.

                Interactions are mainly determined by jutsu type. By default, "Offensive" techniques receive one interaction, while defensive techniques have different options described further in their own collapsible below. There are other factors that may influence interaction potential, but these are all exceptions (i.e Rasengan interacting twice).

                When a technique one rank lower, after all potential modifiers have been considered, collides with and is overtaken by a higher ranked technique, the higher ranked technique's interaction potential is reduced by 2 Ranks. When colliding with techniques of two ranks lower, there is no loss of interaction potential.
                <i>As an example, an A-Rank technique colliding with and punching through a B-Rank jutsu would continue onward without stopping, but would only interact at C-Rank afterwards.</i>

                In some cases, a technique's scope may be wide and reach multiple targets on different sides of the battlefield, such as Area of Effect techniques. When one person within an AoE technique defends, it reduces the interaction potential for the rest of the AoE technique's radius by 2 ranks.
                <i>As an example, a 60-meter AoE fireball targets Person A 30-meters to the left, and Person B 30-meters to the right. Person A defends with a 10-meter radius defensive technique, effectively blocking the technique within that 10-meter area. The rest of the AoE technique's interaction potential is reduced by 2 Ranks.</i>

                <b>Techniques cannot have their interaction value changed more than 2 Ranks</b> from the base rank. This is true of all sources, barring none, including elements, clan KKG, abilities, values, and so on.</div></details>

        <details><summary>VALUES</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Values are the quantifiable aspects of a technique, such as damage, range, or speed, are split into three types: Min, Mid, and Max.

                These refer to the lowest possible value (Min), the middle (Mid) and the highest possible value (Max). SAGA utilizes these terms to establish balance within a technique; you have to determine which areas your jutsu excel in and which aspects fall short.

                Each value is equivalent of two of the values below it. One Max value is equivalent to two Mid values, and one Mid value is equal to two Min values.

                Jutsu receive free Mid or Max values based on the rank of the jutsu. Any other values must be the minimum for the jutsu's rank. S-Rank and Ultimate techniques may not exceed 5 Max Values. All other techniques may not exceed 4 Max Values.

                Techniques of E and D-Rank receive one free Max Value.
                Techniques of C-Rank receive one free Max Value and one free Mid Value.
                Techniques between B and Ultimate-rank receive two free Max Values.

These references are not the be all, end all of jutsu, and simply outranking a jutsu's speed value may not be enough to leverage reacting in time to defend or evade.

                    <b>Speed cannot be buffed above Max value of its own rank.</b>

        <details><summary>DURATION</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Technique durations are measured in units of 'posts'. Measurements of time, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on, are not a legal method of defining a technique's duration. By default, techniques have a duration of one post, and can be increased using Mid or Max Effects.

                A jutsu cannot be activated again until its duration has completely elapsed. They can be activated on successive posts, but you pay the full chakra cost each time you do so. Effects from a previous casting of the same technique may persist between uses, per that technique's description.

                Ultimate techniques (including item active abilities) are limited to use once per thread, and cannot have additional interactions added via another technique or abilities that permit recasting.</div></details>

        <details><summary>ACTIVATION</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Activation refers to the criteria that must be met to cast a jutsu. Most typically, activation is achieved by way of hand seals, however other options exist as well, such as stances or specific, non-attack or combat oriented bodily movements.

                The value used (min/mid/max) determines how quickly a jutsu is cast in reference to other jutsu being cast and how much bodily input is required. Regardless of the flavour used to describe the manner of activation, the only determining factor for speed is the value. A mid value activation that required one hand seal would not be faster than a mid value activation that required a different bodily movement.

                <b>Example:</b> Two jutsu of the same rank are cast at the same time. One technique has min value activation and the other has mid value activation. The technique with mid value activation would be cast first.

        <details><summary>DEFENSIVE VALUES</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Some techniques create a shield, barrier, or armor created by a jutsu in order to defend against other (usually offensive) techniques. Defensive techniques can withstand any number of jutsu two ranks or below its own rank without losing interaction, provided it could defend against them in the first place.

                The following options are available for defensive techniques to utilize:

                <table class="effects-table" border="1">
                    <tr>
                        <td class="ranksheader" rowspan="2">CHOOSE ONE</td>
                        <td class="ranksheader" style="background-color: #322850; text-align: left; border-bottom: 2px solid #40355f;">Defend from one jutsu of up to one rank above the jutsu rank.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="ranksheader" style="background-color: #322850; text-align: left;">Defend from two jutsu of equal rank or equivalent lesser to jutsu rank.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                Using either of the above options counts as a Max Value.

                Techniques that utilize both offensive and defensive values, referred to as "Offensive/Defensive" types, require two max values ; one to utilize damage values and one to utilize defensive values. Once such a technique expends its interaction potential by defending against a technique or interacting with a defense, it becomes incapable of defending against any more techniques or interacting offensively.

                Reflection techniques, or techniques that clash with another, interact with them, and then persist and change the direction (typically reflected back at the user) can only do so if their interaction potential is not consumed in the initial clash. Additionally, abilities of techniques cannot be replicated when reflected. Reflection techniques utilize their own values (i.e Damage, Speed, etc) on techniques they reflect, and cannot take or utilize the reflected technique's values.</div></details>

        <details><summary>JUTSU EFFECTS & LIMITED DESCRIPTORS</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">When creating a jutsu, some specific effects are predetermined in the capacity in which they occupy a value. Such specific effects are listed below. Additionally, when creating techniques, keep in mind that like-effects cannot be stacked. That is to say, you cannot have a jutsu that doubles up on defensive values, or utilizes multiple instances of the same effect within the technique without recasting the technique.

This list will continue to evolve over time as certain effects, descriptors, or mechanics become limited due to their efficacy, their general power as a descriptor, or other factors that warrant a bottleneck on how readily available they are. These effects include:

                Teleportation of Living Creatures (Flying Thunder God)
                Buff Overriding (8 Gates)
                Personal Dimensions (Kamui, etc)

                Limb Regeneration

        <details><summary>JUTSU LIMITS</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Rather than outright limiting jutsu in terms of numbers, techniques instead increase in cost incrementally when in use by lower ranked shinobi. This is limited for techniques up to A-Rank, as S-Rank techniques do have a hard limit.

                This means that a D-Rank character could perform an A-Rank technique, however, it would drain their reserves much faster. The cost of using techniques at ranks higher than the character is base cost + 15 per rank.

                As an example; if a D-Rank character attempted to perform an A-Rank technique, it would cost the A-Rank base value (25) plus 15 chakra for every rank between Genin(D-Rank) and the technique(C, B, and A), resulting in 45 additional chakra for a total of 70 to cast the technique. Specializations decrease this cost by 15 chakra, allowing characters to cast techniques one rank above their Skill Rank at base cost.

                S-Rank techniques are limited to 1 at B-Rank*, 3 at A-Rank, 5 at S-Rank, and 10 at Legendary. This number can be increased with EP.

                * <i>B-Rank Characters using S-Rank jutsu come at increased cost; the technique itself costs 100 chakra to use, and can only be used once per thread.</i> This amount <b>cannot</b> be increased with EP.

This is limited to a 1 additional max effect or 2 mid effects. Below are some examples:

                    <div class="sum-content">By default, a character is not immune to the techniques that they cast. That is to say, if a character were to cast a technique that created a dome of fire and walked into it themselves, they would receive damage.

                        There are several values at your disposal to avoid this, if desired, which are as follows:

                        <b>Selective Targeting</b> is a Max Value that allows the user to specifically target those within a technique's radius that they wish not to suffer from the effects of their technique. These targets can be totally excluded from the technique's wrath, including negative supplementary effects or damage. This can also be used to exclude enemies from positive effects.

                        <b>Supplementary AoE</b> is the weaker Mid Value counterpart to Selective Targeting. By default, supplementary techniques cannot be applied to an area or radius. This value must be taken in order to accomplish this feat. In doing so, all within the radius of the technique will have the effects applied to them, be them positive or negative.

                        <b>Line-of-Sight and Autonomous Homing</b> refers respectively to the Mid Value and Max Value that allows an effect to specifically target one individual. Line-of-Sight requires, as the name would suggest, the user to maintain line of sight for the effect to persist. Autonomous does not have this requirement and pursues their target until either duration or interactions have elapsed, or the target is struck.

                        These values can be taken multiple times within a single technique, allowing multiple targets to be selected.

                <details><summary>ENVIRONMENTAL PERMANENCE</summary>
                    <div class="sum-content">Environmental Permanence is a big term to describe the lasting effects of jutsu that persist after the technique's duration. This could be an earth wall that remains standing after the jutsu's duration, or flames that continue to burn. These are not explicitly effects that needed to be stated within a jutsu's description.

                        Environmental Permanence does not equal interaction, however. These remnants of jutsu cannot interact after the technique's duration has ended; they merely exist as part of the environment.
                    </div></details>

                <details><summary>PARALYSIS</summary>
                    <div class="sum-content">
                        <div class="infobox-header">PARTIAL PARALYSIS</div>
                        Partial Paralysis is a <b>mid value</b> split into two parts; its mechanical effect and what is permitted in its descriptor. Partial paralysis' effect can remove the target's ability to cast techniques which possess a min value. It has no effect on techniques with mid or max value activation. The descriptor cannot contain restrictions of the full body and is limited to two limbs or fewer, or an equivalent level of restriction. Rooting in place is considered to be partial paralysis.

                        Partial Paralysis does not prevent the user from moving or casting other techniques, and does not require direct contact with the target.

                        <div class="infobox-header">FULL PARALYSIS</div>
                        Full Paralysis is a <b>max value</b> and advancement of mid value paralysis, following a similar split between effect and descriptor. Full paralysis can remove a target's ability to cast techniques which possess a min or mid value and can situationally restrict max value activation if the descriptor comparison is adequate, but has no effect on max values in which the descriptor cannot physically restrict. The descriptor can contain a variety of methods to accomplish complete bodily restriction.

                        Full paralysis has special criteria it must adhere to in order to be maintained, which are as follows:
                        <ul><li>The user must maintain contact with the target.</li>
                            <li>The user must maintain concentration; they cannot cast jutsu or utilize chakra while enforcing the paralysis effect.</li></ul>

                        <div class="infobox-header">DESCRIPTOR EXCEPTIONS</div>
                        Both partial and max paralysis use a mixture of effect and descriptor to accomplish their intended mechanic. Because of this, certain exceptions exist due to some contradictions between the activation value and descriptors within techniques. When determining if a technique cannot be cast due to paralysis, the descriptor of the technique is compared against the descriptor of the paralyzing technique.

                        For instance, a partial paralysis technique that roots a character's feet to the ground would have no effect on their ability to perform hand seals, while a technique that wrapped around the user's torso and restrained their arms would. In some cases, a technique may have mid value activation that still uses both hands. In the latter example, the restrained character would be unable to cast that technique, because they cannot join their hands to perform that technique.

                        The only time full paralysis' descriptor is compared against another technique is in the case of max value activation that involve bodily movements. If a technique possesses a max value with a descriptor that would logically be restricted by the paralysis technique's descriptor, then it cannot be used. By default, max activation does not require any physical movement.

                        Other means can be utilized to fight while maintaining a paralysis technique, such as clones or puppets, but they cannot be directly controlled by the user's chakra. Any techniques that are cast or maintained that are directly controlled by the user's chakra will automatically end their paralysis technique.

                <details><summary>BUFFING & DEBUFFING</summary>
                    <div class="sum-content">Not to be confused with jutsu that buff the user, this effect is meant to extrapolate on using jutsu to buff other jutsu.

                        Jutsu used to buff another jutsu can only do so with their own values. This is to say that they can only transfer their own mid and max values onto the technique they are buffing. For example, a C-rank technique buffing an A-rank technique with their max value damage will convert the A-rank techniques damage from B-rank to S-rank.

                        A special clause exists for buffing the range of techniques. These values can be buffed outside of their normal scope by adding the range of the buffing technique on top of the already present range values of the technique that is being buffed.

                        Applying the value of the buffing technique to another jutsu have certain limitations based on rank. These limitations can be found below:

        <details><summary>STEALTH AND SENSORY</summary>
            <div class="sum-content">Stealth and Sensory are special jutsu types that require a trait, either the <b>Stealth Mastery</b> or <b>Sensory Shinobi</b> traits respectively, in order to create and utilize techniques of their nature. Quite simply, stealth techniques are jutsu that obscure and hide the user, and sensory techniques are jutsu that augment the user's sensory.

                Stealth and Sensory are both descriptor dependent when interacting with each other. If a sensory technique possesses a descriptor that matches a stealth technique, rank will then determine whether or not they are able to be sensed. In the even of equal ranks, sensory techniques beat stealth techniques (<i>i.e an A-Rank Chakra sensory technique would be able to detect an A-Rank Chakra hiding stealth technique, but not an S-Rank using the same descriptor</i>).

                These types of jutsu are outlined in greater detail in the collapsibles below.

                <details><summary>SENSORY TECHNIQUES</summary>
                    <div class="sum-content">Sensory techniques require the <b>Sensory Shinobi</b> trait to create and use. They are not offensive, defensive, or stat-changing; they allow the user of the jutsu to detect the world or people around them through methods that either enhance their existing senses (i.e. Inuzuka scent sensory), or providing extrasensory perception(i.e Sharingan chakra sensory).

                        The descriptors for a sensory jutsu tells others how your technique is interacting with the world around you. Sensory techniques can only have 2 sensory descriptors, each one counting as its own max value. Additionally, the rank of the sensory jutsu determines the accuracy and range of these descriptors.

                        You can find acceptable distances for area-effect sensory jutsu in the Range section; sensory ranges in this section are counted as a radius effect. The accuracy can be found below.

                Abilities can be changed, however this comes at a steep cost, check the <a href="http://naruto-saga.com/index.php?showtopic=31">Ryo and EP shop</a> for the price. Further, these abilities cannot be copied from other players or characters without their permission.

                Ninja Abilities are created and modded through a character's Jutsu Registry, and stored in their Jutsu List once approved. <b>Ninja Ability values must be included in jutsu creation</b> if applicable to the technique (i.e a buffed value) and listed as such.

                Ninja Abilities may only buff one value per ability, which is considered one Max Value.

            <div class="sum-content">Ultimate Jutsu are techniques that escape the breadth of normal values and limits. These techniques, available only to shinobi of S-Rank and above, are the epitome of their niche; be it inflicting damage and destruction, casting their effects over a broad swathe of land, or accomplishing their effect with utmost perfection, they are truly unmatched in what it is they seek to accomplish.

                Each character may have one Ultimate Jutsu at S-Rank and a second at Legendary.

                S-Rank jutsu utilize special mechanics that are not outright available to other techniques through the normal application process; they can employ special abilities, custom-tailored mechanics, and operate outside of typical guideline restrictions provided that they are not unbalanced. <b>These special mechanics, abilities, etc require their own max value.</b>
