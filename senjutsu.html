    <div class="infobox-body"><div class="infobox-header">SAGE MODE</div>
        <b>Sage Mode</b> refers to the usage of Senjutsu, or 'Nature Chakra', to empower the user through focus and concentration. Sage Mode grants the user access to Senjutsu Chakra, as well as unlocking the 'Senjutsu' specialization when creating techniques. Sage Mode is considered to be an <b>A-Rank</b> technique that costs 25 Chakra to activate and 10 chakra after the first post to maintain, both of which are paid for using the Sage Mode's chakra pool.

        The amount of Senjutsu Chakra available to a character is determined by their Skill Rank. 40 Chakra is given for every rank, starting at D-Rank. (i.e an A-Rank would have 160 Senjutsu Chakra). When the user activates Sage Mode, they start at their maximum Senjutsu Chakra.

        <div class="infobox-header">LEARNING SENJUTSU</div>
        Because Senjutsu is a <b>Locked Specialization</b>, it has special criteria to be unlocked and used. First and foremost, Senjutsu requires the 'Summoning' specialization to be held by the character attempting to learn Senjutsu. Additionally, the character must be at least B-Rank. Additionally, characters <b>cannot</b> learn Senjutsu if they currently possess the Juinjutsu specialization.

        When attempting to learn Senjutsu, the user submits two plot threads centered around them learning Senjutsu. These plot threads must be a minimum of 15 posts from the character attempting to learn Senjutsu. A Modding Request must be made on the Discord Server with these plot threads. Staff will then make a single, labeled d100 roll in the #dice-board channel, and the outcome will determine whether or not the character successfully develops their ability to create Senjutsu. This roll must succeed 50, else the character must submit new plot threads.

        Once learned, the Senjutsu specialization grants a passive sensory radius of 5-meters around the user, making use of the "Nature Chakra" sensory descriptor, and increases the user's chakra pool by 20. When Sage Mode is active, the passive sensory radius is increased to 25-meters.

        If the character unlearns Senjutsu at any point, this chakra and the passive sensory are removed. Senjutsu does not replace Summoning, and requires its own slot.

        <div class="infobox-header">CREATING A SAGE MODE</div>
        At A-Rank, the user can unlock and create their own Sage Mode using the template below, submitted to their Jutsu Registration.

        Sage Mode allows for the creation of both an additional passive ability with an effect related to its Sage Affinity, as well as a Jutsu Ability that can apply to up to 3 Senjutsu techniques. The passive ability is equivalent to an A-Rank maintained technique with no more than one max value, while the Jutsu Ability is S-Rank and cannot stack with any other abilities.

        <div class="infobox-header">SENJUTSU TECHNIQUES</div>
        Senjutsu Techniques are available when a user enters Sage Mode, which is accessible to characters with the Senjutsu specializations. These types of techniques are applied for using the normal jutsu template found in the Jutsu Guide, and must include 'Senjutsu' as the specialization.

        Senjutsu Techniques are paid for using 50% Senjutsu and 50% regular chakra, rounding up to nearest 5 in favour of Senjutsu Chakra (e.g - a C-rank Senjutsu Technique costs 10 Senjutsu Chakra and 5 Regular Chakra).

        Senjutsu Techniques cost 50% more ryo than normal to learn and cannot have their chakra cost reduced by items under normal circumstances. As a result, Senjutsu techniques are afforded a single additional maximum attribute as a free effect when applied for that does not count toward the overall limit. Additionally, when a senjutsu technique is made, the jutsu as a whole will require Sage Mode to be used, else it will not be a Senjutsu Technique. Senjutsu is not an 'optional Specialization' that can be tagged onto any technique for free benefits.

        <div class="infobox-header">MEDITATION</div>
        A character can regenerate Senjutsu Chakra through meditation. To do so, they must stay completely still for an entire turn. This means that they cannot, at any point within their post, cast a technique, perform an action other than meditation, have damage inflicted upon them, or be subject to anything that would directly break their concentration. If they manage to remain entirely still, they regenerate a flat <b>25 Senjutsu Chakra</b> per post. Clones cannot be used to regenerate Senjutsu Chakra for the user.
